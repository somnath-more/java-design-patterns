## Creational Design Pattern
#### Let’s consider a scenario where we want to build a Computer object with various optional components such as a processor, memory, storage, and graphics card

- computer [CPU=i5, RAM=8GB, Graphics=false, Bluetooth=false]
##### 📝 Key Benefits:
✅ You need to construct an object with many optional parts.
✅ You want code that’s readable and chainable.
✅ You want to avoid messy constructors with 10 parameters.
